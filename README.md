# Runner_Game
I built this as a project for The Tech Academy's C# and Unity course. It's a third person game where a man in a brown cowboy hat finds himself in a maze surrounded by Zombies. If they sense his presence, they chase him and try to infect him with their virus. The only way the hero can remain safe is to run through the maze as fast as he can without touching any zombies or any of the contaminated walls of the maze itself.

The fewer the exposures to the contaminations, the less likely he will turn into a zombie.
